      <p class="date"> June 2018 </p>

      <p class="padding">
        This September, I’ll be starting my final year of school at McMaster University — a fact which is finally starting to materialize in my mind.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        I had arrived at McKay Hall on an early Saturday morning in 2014 not knowing what I wanted to study, or who I wanted to become. I had enrolled in the general first year engineering program, hoping it would buy me some time to figure out what I wanted to do with the next 4 or 5 (with co-op) years. Like many 17 year olds, I was interested in a lot of things, and picking just one thing seemed alien and downright mundane to me. I think the only thing I knew I wanted, was to be a generalist — someone with a broad base of knowledge, and the ability to pick things up quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        And I suppose the past 4ish years have reflected that. I chose a major that is as eclectic as there could have been — electrical and biomedical engineering. I chose internships and co-ops (or they chose me) that spanned a wide variety of industries and roles. I chose friends (or they chose me) who are as diverse in their interests and backgrounds as I am, and made lasting relationships that I now cherish more than anything else.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        My career aspirations were just as varied. I initially started off wanting to go into medicine, infatuated with the ability to save lives and help others in their darkest hour. But that fizzled out. I became interested in robotics, and learned to build & design them in an incredible surgical robotics lab — a place where I worked with some of the most intelligent and generous people I’ve ever met.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        I eventually became interested in software engineering and data science, and so I learned about those fields and joined amazing teams that were constantly building new things. And now, I’m spending my final internship as a quantitative researcher in the world of investment management.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        And the only thing common thread has been: “I never thought I’d end up here.”
      </p>


      <p class="padding">
        There have also been a ton of rough patches along the way — blunders which I deeply regret making. I really came to appreciate the old adage — ‘anything worth doing in life ain’t easy.’
      </p>


      <p class="padding">
        But these last few years have been as formative as they could have been. I came to appreciate things which before I thought only had a nominal value to my world view, both intellectually and emotionally. I understood more about who I was, and what I value more than anything else — my family, my friends and my health.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        Looking back, I think would have done things differently. I probably should’ve majored in computer science — I was more naturally inclined to it. I probably should have focused on the important things more, and ignored the minutiae.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        In all fairness, I do still have one year left in university and going forward, I want to correct these misgivings and make the most of these remaining days.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        But I’m glad I have some regrets about the way things played out — it’s the only way to make things better.
      </p>
