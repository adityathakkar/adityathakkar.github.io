      <p class="date"> August 2018 </p>

      <p class="padding">
        On the whole, artificial intelligence will make world class <a class="bold-num" style="color: black;">healthcare accessible to everyone</a>. And this is due to one fact: <a class="bold-num" style="color: black;">brains are getting cheaper</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        But, I think there are a couple important macro trends that will emerge as we start to deploy machine learning solutions into medicine, that will lead to the result mentioned above.
      </p>
      
      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        1. Diagnostics Will Be Automated
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        Computer scientists are now able to write algorithms that can classify tumors on MRIs better than human radiologists can, and classify skin lesions better than human dermatologists can.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        All of this improved performance can be achieved at a very small fraction of the price of a fully trained doctor. These models can also be delivered to everyone around the world in the form of a software update to phones and computers. This will be incredibly powerful, where even the poorest places in the world will be able to receive world class care.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        2. Treatment Plans Will Be Automated
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        Computers can mine and understand vast amounts of medical data, and conduct A/B tests on how certain treatment plans will affect you based on your personal parameters (genes, height, weight etc.) in the form of precision medicine. All of this will lead to better outcomes at lower costs.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        3. Surgery Will Take a Long Time to Automate
      </p>

      <p class="padding" >
        Having worked in a surgical robotics lab, I can say without a doubt that robotics are hard, and especially surgical robotics. Robotics consists of atoms (the mechanical rigs), and bits (the algorithms that run them), and both of these are incredibly challenging. Surgery is more of a frontier space for artificial intelligence, and we’ve yet to see any major progress in automated robotic surgery.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        The current state of surgery for now is that our human surgeons are vastly better. But automated robotic surgery, if successful, will crush the cost of surgery by orders of magnitude, and this can only be good for the world.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        4. The “Human Element”
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        A large piece of healthcare is the “care” portion. Compassion cannot be automated, and is critical to the healing process. Bedside manner will be more important than ever.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        5. Back Testing is Incredibly Important
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        The amount of medical data has exploded in the past few years, and there is incredible value in going back and testing the processes we have now, and gut-check what we know with this new data.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        6. The Best Option is Combining Humans and Machines (For Now)
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        Because computers only work where we have data (and lots of it), the edge cases will require human help. Machines are not creative. Humans are. The optimal solution is to let machines handle the routine cases, and deploy our most talented doctors and scientists on the true edge cases in medicine, where we can forge new ground and learn more about the human body.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        Hurdles to Overcome
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        All of this will take time. Healthcare is highly regulated in most markets and therefore is not subject to free market forces. It’s an incredibly complicated and sometimes non-meritocratic system, where the best ideas and solutions don’t always win.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        There will be lots of lobbying and laws drafted to block algorithms from being used in hospitals. Healthcare data is very disjointed, and there are lots of privacy issues around data sharing. But progress will prevail and eventually artificial intelligence will make its way in.
      </p>

      <p class="padding">
        Nurses will play a larger role in patient care than ever before. Physicians as we know them today may not exist in the future, and could just be a bunch of computer scientists along with fundamental biological scientists deployed to solve medicine’s hardest problems.
        These kinds of drastic changes will be painful, and the system will resist them. But when we can help get better care to more people and save more lives, the changes must occur.
      </p>

      <p class="padding bold-num" style="color: black;">
        All in all, software is eating medicine. And this is a great thing for humanity.
      </p>
